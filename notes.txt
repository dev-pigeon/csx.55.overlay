a 'k' regular graph of order n is one in which all vertices have the same amount of edges (or the same degree)
    k = number of edges for each node to have
    n = the number of nodes in the graph

the registry deals with connections by first deciding how to connect, then messaging those nodes that they need to connect to those other nodes
    if registry messages node A to connect to node B, that message will contain the address of node B, so that a socket can be spawned
    node B will also be messaged to connect to node A 


upon reading the assignment sheet it looks like message types are simply denoted by integers 
    diff integers correspond to diff message types!




receiver receives a message, then it determines the type, passes that into to the factory 
which spawns an Event of the correct tpye, all wireformats have the interface so you can call like getBytes
setBytes and whatever -> yay you can parse messages now!!!
