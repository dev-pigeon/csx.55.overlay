a 'k' regular graph of order n is one in which all vertices have the same amount of edges (or the same degree)
    k = number of edges for each node to have
    n = the number of nodes in the graph

the registry deals with connections by first deciding how to connect, then messaging those nodes that they need to connect to those other nodes
    if registry messages node A to connect to node B, that message will contain the address of node B, so that a socket can be spawned
    node B will also be messaged to connect to node A

tcp server protocol 
 all this does is wait for socket connections
 as soon as a socket has connected, a TCPReceiverThread is spawned
